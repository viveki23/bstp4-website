         <hr>
         <p>I’ve been blogging from 2013.
           I started dozens of sites, some of them failed and some of them succeeded.
           I’ve tried most of the monetization strategies out there when it comes to blogging.
           I tried and tested many things.
           Some of them worked, some of them didn’t.
           Many people think that there’s some secret that pros are hiding from you and that is preventing you from earning
           good money from your blog.
           No.
           There’s nothing called “secret”.
           You need to put the right kind of effort, that’s the secret to success.
           Or else, I’ll not be here putting tremendous value for you guys in the form of in-depth blog posts here at amazon.</p>
         <p>Enough of this, let’s dive in.
           When starting any blog, it’s very essential to know what are the all the possible ways to monetize your blog.
           When you have that clarity in your head, you will be able to choose a winning niche and play a game that you know
           you’ll win.
           In this guide, I’ll be giving you a crystal-clear clarity about what are all the possible ways by which you can earn
           money from blogging </p>

               You can host your training courses on platforms like Udemy or on self-hosted platforms like Teachable.
               Apart from training courses, you can also offer consultation and mentoring on your blog as I described you earlier.
               As a blogger, you already have an existing audience in your blog, who may be interested in buying your courses. All
               you need to do is check whether your audience are ready to buy training courses.
               You can do this with the help of surveys, polls, and also asking your already existing subscribers.
